1.) I also noticed that the i in I've is lowercase and the h inhere on the top link is lowercase. I would either make both "here"s have either both lowercase or both uppercase.
- changed the I’ve to I’ve in the h3 on line 29 html.

2.) You may also want to consider using different photos in your "places I have worked" section than you did in the "some of the places I have traveled" section. 
- changed both images in places I’ve worked, line 52 and 53 html so they are different than the ones in the places I have traveled section.
